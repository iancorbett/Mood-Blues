# Project-1 (Mood Blues)

README

The Mood Music Playlist asks for user input and generates a playlist according to the answers given.

Anyone who enjoys a variety of art & music will be able to use this application, as it is easy and straightforward to use.

HOW IT WORKS

The application starts on a page similar to a form that prompts the user to answer from two drop-down menus: one asking for Mood and one asking for Genre.

A playlist of five songs will then be generated according to the user's Mood & Genre answers. The user is also given the option to be given a pre-determined list of songs when clicking the Random Playlist Generator

The background color of the playlist will also change depending on the users' Mood answer.

The playlist page will also include a Back button, which will take the user back to the form page, such as to switch moods or to generate a playlist of new songs.
